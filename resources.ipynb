He describes it with a mixture of awe and apprehension, noting its size, age, and the picturesque, albeit wild, Transylvanian landscape surrounding it. He finds the Count to be a courteous and intriguing host, though somewhat eccentric.\n",

He begins to notice unsettling details: the lack of servants, the Count's nocturnal habits, the locked doors, and the increasingly oppressive atmosphere.  His initial awe transforms into suspicion, then fear, and finally, outright terror as he realizes he is a prisoner and Dracula is a vampire. The castle, once a place of fascination, becomes a symbol of his confinement and the Count's sinister nature.  He starts to see it not as a grand residence, but as a prison, a place of dark secrets and supernatural horror.\n",
